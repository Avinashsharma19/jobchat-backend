# Job Application & Conditional Chat System

This project is a **full-stack implementation** of the trial assignment: a platform that supports job applications and **conditional real-time chat** between Employers and Job Seekers.

## üèó Architecture & Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication:** JWT (with roles: JobSeeker & Employer)
- **Real-time:** WebSockets using Socket.IO
- **Cache Layer:** Redis (caching last 20 messages per chat)

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Real-time Client:** Socket.IO client
- **HTTP Client:** Axios

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Flow

1. **Employer** registers/logs in and posts a job.  
2. **JobSeeker** registers/logs in and applies to that job with a cover note.  
3. **Employer** views all applications for their job.  
4. **Employer** accepts/rejects an application.  
   - If accepted ‚Üí a `Chat` is created between Employer & JobSeeker.  
5. **Employer & JobSeeker** exchange messages in real-time.  
   - Recent messages served from Redis.  
   - Full chat history stored in MongoDB.

## üîå How WebSockets & Redis Are Integrated

- **WebSockets:**  
  When an application is accepted, both Employer & JobSeeker can join the chat room (`chatId`) via Socket.IO.  
  - `joinChat` event ‚Üí join a room  
  - `sendMessage` event ‚Üí save message to MongoDB & broadcast to room  
  - `newMessage` event ‚Üí all participants receive new message in real time  

- **Redis:**  
  - Stores the last **20 messages per chat** for quick retrieval.  
  - On `joinChat`, server first checks Redis cache:  
    - If found ‚Üí returns cached messages  
    - Else ‚Üí fetches from MongoDB and populates cache

## üóÑ Schema Design

### User
```js
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  role: "Employer" | "JobSeeker"
}
```

### Job
```js
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  employer: ObjectId (ref User)
}
```

### Application
```js
{
  job: ObjectId (ref Job),
  seeker: ObjectId (ref User),
  coverNote: String,
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected"
}
```

### Chat
```js
{
  participants: [ObjectId], // Employer & JobSeeker
  application: ObjectId (ref Application)
}
```

### Message
```js
{
  chat: ObjectId (ref Chat),
  sender: ObjectId (ref User),
  text: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Job_App_Assignment
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `/backend`:

```ini
PORT=5000

REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Run backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env` in `/frontend`:

```ini
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Run frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
